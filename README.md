### 4️⃣ 🎯 Target Engineering

After feature engineering, the target variable was created using future returns.

Instead of using a fixed threshold, multiple threshold ranges were tested to find the optimal value.

🔬 Thresholds Tested
Wide range evaluated:
0.001 → 0.010 (0.1% → 1%)
Each threshold was tested by:
Training models
Comparing Accuracy & Balanced Accuracy
Evaluating prediction stability
🏆 Final Target Threshold

✅ 0.004 (0.4%) selected as optimal threshold

📌 Target Definition
If Return > 0.004 → 1 (UP)
Else → 0 (DOWN)
📊 Target Distribution
Target distribution was visualized to:
Check class imbalance
Ensure proper UP/DOWN balance
Validate quality of labeling
💡 Benefits
Reduces noise from very small price movements
Avoids overly strict classification
Improves model stability
Leads to better Balanced Accuracy

### 5️⃣ 📌 Feature Selection

Final features used:

* Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
* MA10, MA20, MA50
* Volatility_10, Volatility_20
* RSI, MACD
* Return_1, Return_3, Return_7

---

### 6️⃣ 🔀 Train-Test Split

* Data split into training and testing sets
* Ensures model generalization

---

### 7️⃣ 🤖 Models Dictionary

Multiple models compared:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* SVM
* KNN
* XGBoost

---

### 8️⃣ 🧪 Train & Compare Models

Each model evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Balanced Accuracy

📊 A final comparison table was created to select the best model.

---

### 🏆 9️⃣ Model Selection

> ✅ **XGBoost selected as final model**

**Why?**

* Highest Balanced Accuracy
* Handles non-linear financial data
* Robust to noise
* Provides feature importance

---

### 🏋️ 🔟 Final Training + Probability Threshold Optimization

After selecting XGBoost:

* Model retrained and optimized
* Probability thresholds tested:

> 🔬 **0.35 → 0.40 range**

Fine-tuning performed:

* 0.36, 0.37, **0.38**, 0.39

---

### 🏆 Final Probability Threshold

> ✅ **0.38 gives best confusion matrix**

**Benefits:**

* Better BUY/SELL balance
* Reduced false signals
* Improved real-world performance

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ 📉 Confusion Matrix Evaluation

Used to analyze:

* True Positives
* False Positives
* False Negatives

🎯 Goal:

* Reduce wrong BUY signals
* Maintain good UP detection

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ 💾 Model Saving

```python
joblib.dump(model, "xgboost.pkl")
```

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ 🖥️ UI Deployment (Streamlit)

* Load saved model
* User inputs:

  * Stock ticker
  * Time period

System performs:

* Data fetching
* Feature engineering
* Prediction

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ 🔮 Prediction Logic

| Condition             | Signal  |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Pred = 1 & Prob > 0.6 | 🟢 BUY  |
| Pred = 0 & Prob > 0.6 | 🔴 SELL |
| Otherwise             | 🟡 HOLD |
